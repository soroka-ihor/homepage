              <h3>Childhood & Early Life</h3>
              <div class="trans">
                <ul class="timeline">
                  <li>Kojima was born in Tokyo, Japan in 1963, but his family moved to western Japan shortly after his
                    birth. Growing up as a latchkey kid, he had to deal with loneliness and loss as a child, when his
                    father
                    passed away while he was just 13 years old.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    From an early age, he knew that he wanted to be a writer and illustrator, but faced a lot of
                    pressure
                    to seek out a safer and financially stable line of work. Despite discouragement from his family and
                    peers, as a teen, he wrote and illustrated original short stories and sent them to magazines,
                    although
                    none ever got published.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    While attending college and studying economics, Kojima spent a lot of his free time playing video
                    games, which at the time was a new medium that hadn't been explored much.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    He shocked his peers by announcing in his fourth year of college that he wanted to design video
                    games,
                    even though his previous ambition had been to become a film director. Even though most of his
                    friends
                    discouraged him from pouring his energy into an untested creative outlet, he cites unwavering
                    support
                    from his mother as a big influence in his decision to pursue video games.
                  </li>

              <h3>Career</h3>

              <div class="trans">
                <ul class="timeline">
                  <li>
                    Kojima's early career was marked by a lot of rejection, and his video game ideas failed to gain any
                    traction with publishers. In 1986 he was hired by the game publisher ‘Konami Digital Entertainment’
                    to
                    work in their MSX home computer division as a designer and planner.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Owing to the system's limited color palette and resources, the assignment was a bit of a
                    disappointment to the creative and imaginative Kojima, who had hoped to work on the more colorful
                    Nintendo system.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Many of Kojima's early ideas were refused, but he got his big breakthrough when he was asked to take
                    over a project called ‘Metal Gear’. He fixed problems with the game's clunky combat system by
                    instead
                    focusing the game play on sneaking and subterfuge.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Released in 1987, the first ‘Metal Gear’ game introduced its tough protagonist ‘Solid Snake’ to the
                    world, and the title remains one of Kojima's most recognizable and successful franchises.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    During the '90s Kojima's career finally took off and he began developing his own projects for the
                    ‘Konami MSX2’ as well as for other gaming systems, including a sequel to his breakout hit ‘Metal
                    Gear’.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In 1998, the release of his PlayStation title ‘Metal Gear Solid’ brought him to the attention of
                    industry insiders and fans alike and he became a celebrity in the video game world.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    He kicked of the '00s with a sequel to ‘MGS’ which was one of the most highly anticipated game
                    releases ever at the time. He repeated his success in 2001 with the release of the video game and
                    anime franchise ‘Zone of Enders’. By the end of the decade he had come up with several other
                    projects,
                    including several ‘MGS’ sequels and spinoffs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    On April 1, 2011, Kojima was promoted to Vice President of ‘Konami Digital Entertainment’. This
                    promotion was a step up from his previous title of Vice President of ‘Konami Computer Entertainment
                    Japan’ and gave him almost unparalleled creative control over one of the most popular game
                    publishers
                    in the world.
                  </li>

              <h3>Major Works</h3>

              <div class="trans">
                <ul class="timeline">
                  <li>
                    Beginning with the release of the first iteration in 1986, the ‘Metal Gear’ franchise is Kojima's
                    biggest and most recognizable contributions to the gaming world. The main character of the title,
                    ‘Solid Snake’, has even made appearances in other video games like ‘Nintendo's Super Smash Bros
                    Brawl’.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Another major Kodjima's work was Death Stranding. Death Stranding, the newest video game from the
                    developer Hideo Kojima, was introduced to the world in the summer of 2016 on a stage at the
                    Electronic
                    Entertainment Expo (E3), the gaming industry’s annual trade-show extravaganza. The event was what
                    the
                    industry calls a press conference, but this particular spectacle more closely resembled the scene in
                    “King Kong” when the beast is displayed to the public in a Broadway theater. A live orchestra struck
                    up a blaring John Williams-style score as the curtain lifted to reveal a sloping stage, at the very
                    top of which stood Kojima, a slight Japanese man with swooping black hair and glasses. The floor
                    began
                    to light up underneath him, panes of light flying in from left and right to create a sort of light
                    bridge, which he bounded down to shake a Sony executive’s hand. Then he stood at center stage,
                    beaming, to deafening applause.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

                  <li>
                    In 2009 the entertainment website IGN named him number six in their list of top game creators of all
                    time. That year he also received a ‘Lifetime Achievement Award’ at the ‘Game Developers Conference’.

                    Kojima is unmarried and has no children, but continues to enjoy the support of his mother. She even
                    plays his video games, and it is believed she took an entire year to finish ‘MGS3’.
